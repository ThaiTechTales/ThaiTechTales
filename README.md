Hey there! I'm Thai, a tech enthusiast and an Analyst Cloud Engineer at Deloitte. I‚Äôm passionate about learning and creating impactful solutions, and I love working across various technologies, from cloud computing to machine learning. I‚Äôm always excited to take on new challenges‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs building scalable systems, diving into real-time data streaming, or exploring cutting-edge AI tools. I believe in pushing boundaries and finding innovative solutions. Let‚Äôs keep pushing forward. We got this!

I'm currently exploring a diverse range of technologies to deepen my expertise and build impactful solutions:

- üå©Ô∏è **AWS**: To harness the power of cloud computing for scalable and secure solutions.
- üîß **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Mastering **Terraform** and **CloudFormation** for efficient and automated deployments.
- üìä **Data Engineering**: Building robust data pipelines and workflows for actionable insights.
- ü§ñ **Machine Learning**: Leveraging tools like **TensorFlow** for cutting-edge AI models.
- üîÑ **Kafka**: For managing real-time data streams effectively.
